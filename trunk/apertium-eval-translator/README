apertium-eval-translator 1.0.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple Perl script to evaluate Apertium-based machine translation
systems.

This software calculates (at document level) the word error rate (WER)
and the position-independent word error rate (PER) between a
translation performed by the Apertium MT system and a reference
translation obtained by post-editing the system output.

For more information execute the script (after installation) 
without arguments

$ apertium-eval-translator
