<h2>Apertium-transfer-tools</h2>
<h3>Automatic shallow-transfer rules generation from parallel corpora</h3>

<p><code>apertium-transfer-tools</code> is an open-source package consisting of a set of tools that allow the automatic generation of Apertium (level 1) transfer rules from parallel corpora. Transfer rules are generated from alignment templates, like those used in statistical machine translation, that have been extracted from parallel corpora and extended with a set of restrictions controlling their application.</p>

<p>The generated transfer rules (in XML format) can be directly used by the Apertium MT platform. Although this package is aimed at the generation of Apertium transfer rules it can be adapted to generate shallow-transfer rules for other MT platforms; moreover, some of the tools it provides can be used for other purposes such as the extraction of bilingual phrase pairs or the symmetrization of previously computed alignments. This package depends on the <a href="http://www.fjoch.com/GIZA++.html">GIZA++</a> toolkit to compute word alignments; nevertheless, it can be easily adapted to use other aligners.</p>
