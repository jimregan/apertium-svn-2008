<h2>Apertium-tagger-training-tools</h2>
<h3>Target-language driven part-of-speech tagger trainer</h3>
<p><code>apertium-tagger-training-tools</code> is an open-source package that can be used to train (in an unsupervised way) hidden-Markov-model-based part-of-speech taggers involved in machine translation. While training information, not only from the source language, but also from the target language is used; to this end the Apertium MT toolbox is used. After training a file containing the hidden-Markov-model parameters is produced; this file can be directly used within the Apertium MT toolbox. This package may simplify the initial building of an Apertium-based machine translation system for a new pair of languages.</p>
