---------------------------------------------------------------------

To use this package you need:

* To provide a parallel corpus in the usual format, one sentence per
  line. This parallel corpus must be in two gziped files (one per
  language):
  - L1.txt.gz
  - L2.txt.gz

* To have GIZA++ installed with all the stuff needed to run GIZA++
  properly.

* Apertium data for the language pair involved. Obviously you do not
  need to have the transfer rules files, you need:
  - Two monolingual dictionaries (one for each language)
  - A bilingual dictionary
  - The input files (.prob) used by the part-of-speech tagger for each
    language

In this folder you can find: 

* A 'Makefile' in which you can specify all the parameters used for
  the extraction of the alignment templates and the posterior generation
  of transfer rules. You may need to change the value for the following
  variables:
   - DATADIR must be the path in which the Apertium linguistic is
   - GIZADIR must be the path to the GIZA++ installation
   - L1 must be one of the languages involved
   - L2 must be the other language involved

* An script to filter the extracted alignment templates
  ('filter_alignment_templates.awk'). Yo do not need to modify it.

* Various scripts with the form 'preprocess_L1_L1-L2.sh' to preprocess
  the output of the part-of-speech tagger when analyzing the L1.txt.gz
  corpus to translate for language L1 to language L2. Note that the
  scripts provided do not perform any transformation, but they could
  need to perform some transformations (depending on the language pair)
  because of the tagger output. 

* Two XML files with the form 'apertium-es-pt.transfer-at.L1-L2.atx'
  defining which categories are lexicalized for the extraction of the
  alignment templates that are then used to generate the transfer rules
  to translate from L1 to L2.

* An XML file 'apertium-es-pt.posttransfer.ptx' defining the set of
  multi-lexical units to be used by the apertium-posttransfer
  program. Multi-lexical units are for verbs with clitics pronouns. 

* An XML file 'modes.xml' to be used to translate when using the
  automatically inferred transfer rules. Apertium linguistic
  packages uses the modes.xml file to select which modules must be
  executed to carry out the translation. The modes.xml file provided
  here introduces the use of the apertium-posttransfer module that is
  used to make some lexical units to be joined up (after transference)
  into a multi-lexical unit.

Once you have the needed data to obtained the transfer rules type

$ make

and after a big while you will have two XML files with the inferred
rules:

  - trules.L1-L2.xml
  - trules.L2-L1.xml

These files can be directly used (in conjunction with
apertium-es-pt.posttransfer.ptx file) to carry out the translation
with the Apertium MT engine.


Good luck!
