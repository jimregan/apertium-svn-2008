WARNING - this is as pre-pre-pre-alpha as software gets.

This runs a small web service which interfaces with Apertium,
allowing a user to get a GUI via his or her web browser.

Currently, you must run the service on port 8081 (due
to hardcoding in index.html).

First, run
  tar xjvf js.tar.bz2 in the static directory.

Start the service by executing
  python apertium_service.py 8081

Now, point your browser at
  http://localhost:8081/static/interface/index.html

You should see a very rudimentary interface with a text
box at the top and a text box at the bottom. Chances are
that this setup is NOT going to work for you, due to
hardcoded crap in apertium_service.py and index.html;
specifically:
  - index.html: The line
      url: "http://localhost:8081/translate/en-af"
      ensures that the web service will only attempt English to
      Afrikaans translations.

  - apertium_service.py: The subprocess code assumes that the Apertium
      executables are under /usr/local/bin

If you can fix this hardcoded crap, I would be grateful. I will eventually
do it.
