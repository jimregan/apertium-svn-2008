This package provides a set of tools to train and test the
hidden-Markov-model-based part-of-speech tagger module of the apertium
machine translation engine (http://www.apertium.org).

The main program provided with this package apertium-tagger-tl-trainer
uses information from the target language to train the part-of-speech
tagger used in apertium in an unsupervised way, i. e. without human
intervention. This method has been already described (see below) and
is known to give better results than the standard Baum-Welch algorithm
used to train hidden-Markov-model-based part-of-speech taggers when no
tagged text is available.

Comments on this software are VERY welcome, do not hesitate to write
me for comments, feedback or just to tell me that you found this
software useful.

If you use this software for research, or for any other particular
purpose, I would be very grateful if you could cite one or both of the
following research papers describing this software:
