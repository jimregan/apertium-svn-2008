In order to train the Spanish part-of-speech tagger yo need to place here
some corpora:
* For supervised training: 
  - A file called 'es.tagged' should contain the hand-tagged corpus.
  - A file called 'es.tagged.txt' should contain the same corpus that
    'es.tagged' contains, but in RAW format.

* For unsupervised training:
  - A file called 'es.crp.txt' should contain large corpus in RAW format
