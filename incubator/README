Apertium incubator
==================

What is this?

Well, basically if you've done some work on a dictionary, but 
it doesn't fit into a language pair yet, or you just want 
somewhere to put yout work so others can improve it, this is 
the place. It means that work doesn't get lost on people's
computers, unavailable if someone else wants to work on it.

What can I put here?

Dictionaries, dictionary fragments, rules, things that aren't
quite ready to live in the real world (their own SVN module)
yet.
