Apertium incubator
==================

What is this?

Well, basically if you've done some work on a dictionary, but 
it doesn't fit into a language pair yet, or you just want 
somewhere to put your work so others can improve it, this is 
the place. It means that work doesn't get lost on people's
computers, unavailable if someone else wants to work on it.

What can I put here?

Dictionaries, dictionary fragments, rules, things that aren't
quite ready to live in the real world (their own SVN module)
yet.

So what do I do?

Just add the file you want to store/work-on. If you're feeling
particularly heroic, add a section to the Wiki page:

  http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/wiki/index.php/Incubator

Detailing the location of the dictionary and the resources you've
used.

What is the licence ?

Like the rest of the project, the licence is the GPL, by 
putting your work here you release it under the GPL, a copy
of which can be found in the COPYING file.
