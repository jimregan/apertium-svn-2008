TRANSLATOR

You need apertium-3.0.1 and lttoolbox-3.0.0 to use this translator. To compile
the linguistic data simply do:

./configure [ --prefix=/path/to/your/dir ]
make
make install

inside of this directory.

FORMAT

This translator uses the XInclude style dictionaries, which first need to be
preprocessed. The *.dix files are generated from the *.dix.xml files, so if 
you make changes in the *.dix files and re-compile, the changes will be lost.

All linguistic data is in UTF-8

TAGGER

To use this language-pair package with apertium YOU DO NOT NEED TO
RETRAIN THE TAGGER. Probabilities and auxiliary data are provided for
both the es-gl and the gl-es translation directions which should be
acceptable for most applications.
