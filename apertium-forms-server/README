apertium-forms-server

You need:

* Python > 2.4
* python-webpy
* python-4suite-xml

Known bugs:


Wishlist:

* The gloss should really be attached to each paradigm,
  not to the dictionary.

Files:

The server is broadly laid out along the lines of MVC,
although this is broken when and where I please. 

* interface.py: Holds the class to generate the HTML
* pair.py: Holds the various classes representing the 
  parts of the dictionary we need to use.
* apertium-forms-server.py: Runs the http servlet, and 
  controls POST / GET on the forms.

There is an extra file, config.py, which loads the config
file (normally in config/config.xml) and sets up the 
various structures in pair.py.
