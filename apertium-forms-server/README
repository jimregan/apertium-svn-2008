apertium-forms-server

You need:

* python >= 2.4
* python-webpy
* python-4suite-xml

Known bugs:


Wishlist:

* The gloss should really be attached to each paradigm,
  not to the dictionary.
* Writing files is really slow, but it isn't in PHP,
  what do they do differently? Is this something that can
  be fixed in cDomlette at the expense of more memory?
* In some cases the code is overly complex, possibly 
  double checking variables. It was written in a hurry. 
  Probably it would be good to go through each function
  and check for this sort of thing.

Files and directories:

The server is broadly laid out along the lines of MVC,
although this is broken when and where I please. 

* interface.py: Holds the class to generate the HTML.
* pair.py: Holds the various classes representing the 
  parts of the dictionary we need to use.
* apertium-forms-server.py: Runs the http servlet, and 
  controls POST / GET on the forms.

There is an extra file, config.py, which loads the config
file (normally in config/config.xml) and sets up the 
various structures in pair.py.

The static/ directory contains javascript and CSS that 
needs to be served statically. This needs to be here for
webpy to show them

Coding style:

I like braces, they make blocks easier to distinguish. I
use them in python even thought often it makes coding 
difficult. For example, I try to avoid using if/elseif/else
blocks, because python does not provide a way to use my 
preferred coding style:

if x < y: #{

#} else: #{

#}

So, if possible, try and do the same, sometimes in 
desperation I do:

if x < y: #{

else: #{

#}

Probably best to avoid it though.
