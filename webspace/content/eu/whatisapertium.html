<h2>What is Apertium?</h2>

<p>Apertium is an <b>open-source machine translation platform</b>, initially aimed at related-language pairs but recently expanded to deal with more divergent language pairs (such as English-Catalan). The platform provides</p>

<ol class="abc">
	<li>a language-independent machine translation engine</li>
	<li>tools to manage the linguistic data necessary to build a machine translation system for a given language pair and</li>
	<li>linguistic data for a growing number of language pairs.</li>
</ol>
 
<p>Apertium uses a shallow-transfer machine translation engine which processes the input text in stages, as in an assembly line: de-formatting, morphological analysis, part-of-speech disambiguation, shallow structural transfer, lexical transfer, morphological generation, and re-formatting.</p>
<p>Apertium uses finite-state transducers for all lexical processing operations (morphological analysis and generation, lexical transfer), hidden Markov models for part-of-speech tagging, and multi-stage finite-state based chunking for structural transfer.</p>
<p>The initial design was largely based upon that of systems already developed by the Transducens group at the Universitat d'Alacant, such as <b><a href="http://www.internostrum.com/welcome.php">interNOSTRUM</a></b> (Spanish-Catalan, and <b><a href="http://traductor.universia.net">Traductor Universia</a></b> (Spanish-Portuguese).</p>
<p>It is possible to use Apertium to build machine translation systems for a variety of language pairs; to that end, Apertium uses simple XML-based standard formats to encode the linguistic data needed (either by hand or by converting existing data), which are compiled using the provided tools into the high-speed formats used by the engine.</p>
