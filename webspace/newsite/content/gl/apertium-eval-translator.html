<h2>Apertium-eval-translator</h2>
<h3>Evaluation of Apertium-based MT systems</h3>

<p><code>apertium-eval-translator</code> is a very simple script written in Perl. It calculates the word error rate (WER) and the position-independent word error rate (PER) between a translation performed by an Apertium-based MT system and its human-corrected translation at document level. Although it has been designed to evaluate Apertium-based systems, it can be easily adapted to evaluate other MT systems.</p>
