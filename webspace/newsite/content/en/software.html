<h3>lttoolbox lexical transformation package</h3>
<p>The lttoolbox lexical transformation package in Apertium is used by <a href="http://orthoepikon.sourceforge.net/">Orthoepikon</a> to build software that adds simple pronunciation annotations to texts so that they can be read aloud correctly.<a href="?id=lttoolbox">[+]</a></p>

<h3>apertium-tagger-training-tools</h3>
<h4>Target-language driven part-of-speech tagger trainer</h4>
<p>The apertium-tagger-training-tools package can be used to unsupervisedly train the part-of-speech taggers used within the Apertium MT engine by using information not only from the source language, but also from the target language.</p>

<p>After training a file containing the hidden-Markov-model parameters used by the part-of-speech tagger is produced; this file can be directly used within the Apertium MT toolbox. This package may simplify the initial building of a machine translation system for a new pair of languages.<a href="?id=apertium-tagger-training-tools">[+]</a></p>


<h3>Apertium-transfer-tools</h3>
<h4>Automatic shallow-transfer rules generation from parallel corpora</h4>

<p><code>apertium-transfer-tools</code> is an open-source package consisting of a set of tools that allow the automatic generation of Apertium (level 1) transfer rules from parallel corpora. Transfer rules are generated from alignment templates, like those used in statistical machine translation, that have been extracted from parallel corpora and extended with a set of restrictions controlling their application. <a href="?id=apertium-transfer-tools">[+]</a></p>

<h3>Apertium-eval-translator</h3>
<h4>Evaluation of Apertium-based MT systems</h4>

<p><code>apertium-eval-translator</code> is a very simple script written in Perl. It calculates the word error rate (WER) and the position-independent word error rate (PER) between a translation performed by an Apertium-based MT system and its human-corrected translation at document level. Although it has been designed to evaluate Apertium-based systems, it can be easily adapted to evaluate other MT systems.<a href="?id=apertium-eval-translator">[+]</a></p>
