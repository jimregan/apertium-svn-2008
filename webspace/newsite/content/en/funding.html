<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>Apertium is one of the two open-source machine translation engines whose development started inside project <a href="http://www.opentrad.org/">OpenTrad</a> (2004–2005); Apertium is designed to translate between related languages (see Documentation below). The OpenTrad consortium was led by <a href="http://www.eleka.net/">Eleka Ingeniaritza Linguistikoa</a>.
</p>

<p>The Opentrad project ("Open Source Machine Translation for the languages of Spain") was funded by the <a href="http://www.min.es/">Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce</a> of Spain through PROFIT grant numbers FIT340101-2004-0003 and FIT340001-2005-0002.
</p>

<p>More recently, Apertium has also received funding from the <a href="http://www10.gencat.net/dursi/AppJava/home.jsp?area=3&=2">Secretariat for Telecommunications and Information Society</a> of the Generalitat de Catalunya (the government of the autonomous community of Catalonia in Spain) to develop new language pairs and an improved architecture (Apertium 2.0) to include more difficult pairs such as English–Catalan, and again from the <a href="http://www.min.es/">Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce</a> of Spain through <a href="http://www.mityc.es/profit/">PROFIT</a> grant number FIT350401-2006-05 (EurOpenTrad).
</p>

<p>Parts of Apertium have also been funded by the <a href="http://www.ua.es/">Universitat d'Alacant</a>.</p>
