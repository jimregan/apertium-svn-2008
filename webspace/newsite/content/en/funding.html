<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>Apertium is one of the two open-source machine translation engines whose development started inside project <a href="http://www.opentrad.org/">OpenTrad</a> (2004–2005); Apertium is designed to translate between related languages. The OpenTrad consortium was led by <a href="http://www.eleka.net/">Eleka Ingeniaritza Linguistikoa</a>.
</p>

<p>The Opentrad project ("Open Source Machine Translation for the languages of Spain") was funded by the <a href="http://www.min.es/">Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce</a> of Spain through PROFIT grant numbers FIT340101-2004-0003 and FIT340001-2005-0002.
